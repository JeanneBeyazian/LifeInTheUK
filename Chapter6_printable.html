    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>

    </ul>

    <h2>1. Constitutional Arrangements</h2>

    <div class="important">
        <p>The UK does not have a single written constitution. Instead, it has a collection of laws, conventions, and court judgments that together establish how the country is governed.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Key Constitutional Principles</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-point">Parliamentary sovereignty</span>: Parliament is the supreme legal authority and can create or end any law</li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Rule of law</span>: Everyone is subject to the same laws, which are publicly created and fairly enforced</li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Constitutional monarchy</span>: The monarch is the Head of State but has limited powers</li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Separation of powers</span>: Division between legislature (Parliament), executive (Government), and judiciary (Courts)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sources of the Constitution</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="key-point">Legislation</span>: Acts of Parliament, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>Bill of Rights 1689</li>
                <li>Act of Settlement 1701</li>
                <li>Acts of Union 1707 (England and Scotland)</li>
                <li>Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949</li>
                <li>Human Rights Act 1998</li>
                <li>Constitutional Reform Act 2005</li>
                <li>Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Conventions</span>: Non-legal rules and customs that are followed by political institutions</li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Common law</span>: Legal principles developed through court judgments</li>
        <li><span class="key-point">Works of authority</span>: Academic writings that are considered influential</li>
    </ul>

        <ol>
            <li><span class="key-point">First Reading</span>: Formal introduction of the bill, no debate</li>

            <ul>
                <li>Membership of the European Union (pre-Brexit)</li>
                <li>Devolution to Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland</li>
